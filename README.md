The objective of this project is to design and verify the functionalities of an ALU which implements the following arithmetic and logical operations:
• Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Increment and Decrement 
• Logical: AND, OR, XOR, NOT 
• Logical shift and rotate operations 
• Comparison: Equal, less than, greater than 
An important aspect of this design is its verification. To ensure the correctness and robustness of the ALU, a self-checking testbench will be developed. This testbench will automatically 
apply a series of test vectors to the ALU and validate the output against expected results. This approach eliminates manual testing and enhances the reliability of the verification process by 
covering a broad range of input conditions and edge cases.
